This project, part of the CS4240 Deep Learning course at TU Delft, aims to reproduce the paper "Data-driven discovery of coordinates and governing equations" by K. Champion et al. The repository includes code implementations, datasets, and a comprehensive analysis of the results presented in the original paper as well as those from our replication efforts.
